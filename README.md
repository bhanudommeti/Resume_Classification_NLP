**String** : After application of String, removing all the punctuations.

**Porter Stemmer** : Removing suffixes from the words in English.

**Lemmatization** : Breaking a word down to its root meaning to identify the similarities.

**Count Vectorizer** : Transforming a text into vector on the basis of the frequency of eachÂ word.
